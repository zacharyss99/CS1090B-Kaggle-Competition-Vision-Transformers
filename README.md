# In this homework I did the following
0. Read the groundbreaking paper "AN Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale).
1. Implemented a Vision Transformer (ViT) using TensorFlow
2. Designed custom layers (single-head self attention, multi-head attention, transformer encoder block, etc).
3. Trained model on Quick,Draw! Dataset
4. Evaluated custom model + alterations on Quick,Draw! Dataset

# Grade 9.5/10 (so close but no cigar!). Top 5% performance compared to rest of class.
